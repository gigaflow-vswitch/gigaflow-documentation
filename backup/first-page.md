# Gigaflow Virtual Switch (GvS)
Gigaflow is a multi-table cache architecture for the Open vSwitch (OVS) that captures pipeline-aware locality from the vSwitch pipelines to deliver significantly higher hit rate and lower end-to-end per-packet latency.
Unlike traditional caches (e.g, Megaflow) that capture entire traversals as cache entries, Gigaflow caches sub-traversals that are shared among many flows to capture a cross-product rule space in the SmartNIC.

## Why Gigaflow?

### ðŸš€ Minimizes Traffic Latency

* Captures a cross-product rule spaceâ€”up to 450x bigger than Megaflow!
* Delivers up to 51% higher cache hit rate than traditional Megaflow cache
* Reduces cache misses by up to 90% while using 18% lesser cache entries

### ðŸ’¡ Key Features

* **Pipeline-Aware Locality**: Captures locality from the vSwitch pipelines using disjointedness
* **Longest Traversal Matching (LTM)**: Handles correctness in a multi-table lookup cache architecture 
* **Open vSwitch (OVS) Integration**: Integrated in OVS as a new caching sub-system

### ðŸ”§ Technical Highlights

* Multi-table cache architecture enabling efficient matching across a significantly expanded rule space
* Effeciently captures pipeline-aware locality by maximizing sub-traversal level disjointedness
* SmartNIC offload available for Xilinx Alveo U250 Data Center Accelerator (coming soon!)
