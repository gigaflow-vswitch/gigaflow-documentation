# Gigaflow Virtual Switch (GvS)
Gigaflow is a multi-table cache architecture for the Open vSwitch (OVS) that captures pipeline-aware locality from the vSwitch pipelines to deliver significantly higher hit rate and lower end-to-end per-packet latency.
Unlike traditional caches (e.g, Megaflow) that capture entire traversals as cache entries, Gigaflow caches sub-traversals that are shared among many flows to capture a cross-product rule space in the SmartNIC.

## Why Gigaflow?

### ðŸš€ Lower End-to-End Traffic Latency

* Captures a cross-product rule space in a multi-table cache, up to 450x bigger than Megaflow!
* Delivers significantly cache higher hit rate than traditional Megaflow cache
* Reduces up to 90% cache misses while using 18% lesser cache entries

### ðŸ’¡ Key Features

* **Pipeline-Aware Locality**: Captures locality from the vSwitch pipelines using disjointedness
* **Longest Traversal Matching (LTM)**: Handles correctness in a multi-table lookup cache architecture 
* **Open vSwitch (OVS) Integration**: Integrated in the OVS as a new caching sub-system

### ðŸ”§ Technical Highlights

* Efficient memory pool management (TODO: fix)
* Zero-copy operations for maximum performance (TODO: fix)
* SmartNIC offload available for Xilinx Alveo U250 Data Center Accelerator (coming soon!)
